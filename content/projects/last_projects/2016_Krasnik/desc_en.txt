ProjectName:Residential square 
ProjectLocation:Kraśnik, PL 
ProjectYear:2016 

The idea for the square is inspired by contemporary solutions that are designed to introduce the green housing estate with an emphasis on order and minimalist form.

It is proposed to introduce a circle-shaped path, which is to be the dominant of the composition. The communication system is clear and functional, and gives an interesting decorative element in a view from the upper floors of apartment buildings. 

The geometry of the lines is softened by a path that intersects the square. It divides the suqare into two areas with different functions. The south-east part of it is a place for calm relaxation among the greenery, and the north-west area is more open for recreational functions such as playground. 

The entry point to the square is accentuated with a small paved area with a modern architectural concrete bench of an elegant form. Its accompanied by three concrete & steel planters separating the parking lot from the square. 

The material used for pavements is a clear concrete slab that is perfectly underlining the modern character of the design. 

The square will be equipped with a double swing, carousel, slide, sandbox and roofed resting place for parents, and wooden benches around the circle, bins and lighting lamps.

Introduced plants are - conifers (3 Engelmann’s spruce) and deciduous (7 silver lime trees), hedges of yew shrubs and coniferous and deciduous pot (creeping juniper, mountain pine var. ‚Pumilio’, Euonymus fortunei). 

Selected evergreen species are resistant to severe weather conditions and are very easy to maintain. The proposed lawn is based on modern, but economic solutions, while holding high aesthetic quality for the space housing estate.
