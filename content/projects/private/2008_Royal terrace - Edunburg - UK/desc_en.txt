ProjectName: Royal Palace
ProjectLocation: Edinburgh, UK
ProjectYear:2008

Garden located in a residential area on one of the hills of Edinburgh with a true English character. Surrounded by a high wall and cooled by the shade of old trees.

The intention of the designer was to unearth the historical character of the place by references to classical garden art, for example by using regular systems of hedges. At the same time the "old" manner was broken with contemporary elements- round patio, irregular curving path "tree house" and a green roof. Garden was equipped with lighting, irrigation there was not necessary.

Design credits - Dugal McLeod, project realized during the landscape architecture internship with Agnieszka Anna Olszewska
