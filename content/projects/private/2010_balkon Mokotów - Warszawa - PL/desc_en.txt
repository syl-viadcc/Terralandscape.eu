ProjectName: Balcony Garden
ProjectLocation: Warsaw, PL
ProjectYear:2010



The balcony design is the best example of how to deal with the small area in the space planning. The design was supposed to solve the problem of too much heating and the sunlight which was hard to stand during the summer months. 
Little garden with aromatic plants on the side of the long balcony has an ornamental function and also gives a space an imaginative character thanks to different levelled decks. The decking on the other side of the balcony is a perfect place for outside activities including  cheerful evenings with friends with a glass of wine. Climbers are a natural protection from the sun heat and light during the hot days.
