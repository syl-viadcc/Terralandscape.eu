ProjectName:Terrace Gardens Ex-Castello Tassara 
ProjectLocation:Genova, IT
ProjectYear:2013

Private garden design, which in the past was a part of the property of the Tassara Castle. Garden is located on a steep slope, with south exposition, with a perfect Mediterranean climate. 

Part of the garden has been earmarked for commercial purposes, where we planned cultivation of herbs, organic cultivation of citrus, a small nursery with rhododendrons and azaleas, and a bougainvillea in the greenhouse. Grown fruits, herbs and vegetables will be used in the organic food restaurant planned within the lot.
