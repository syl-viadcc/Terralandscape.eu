ProjectName: Tropical Garden
ProjectLocation: Margate, FL
ProjectYear:2014

One of the best things about being a landscape architect is that you can design a garden for your friends and relatives. That is the case here. We designed and already partly built it. 

The garden near that family house didn't have very interesting program, and was missing some planting. As there is no problem with the plants growing in the tropical climate, it wasn't too difficult to find the right and interesting plants, however the tropical plants demans was a bit of a challenge, because it is our first TROPICAL DESIGN!
