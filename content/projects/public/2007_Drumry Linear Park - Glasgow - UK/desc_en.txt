ProjectName:Drumry Linear Park
ProjectLocation:Glasgow, UK
ProjectYear:2007

The aim of the design is to create a new route through a large area of open space on the outskirts of the Drumry area of Clydebank (Glasgow). In so doing linking surrounding neighborhoods and turning this almost unused space into  a vibrant linear park adding greatly to the health and wellbeing of the local residents.

Interest is created along the path using planting, eart mounding, framing views, forming seating and play areas. There is also the opportunity for artworks along the route. 

The path will be a major recreational resource for passive pursuits such as dog walking and the more active running and cycling. Informal play areas will generate more activity along the route. As this path would link with existing routes such as the canal it allows forextended cycling jogging routes.

At present the area is typically a large "green desert" of mown grass new woodland and parkland tree planting along with newly created meadow areas will greatly increase the habitats in the space as well as making it much more attractive area.
