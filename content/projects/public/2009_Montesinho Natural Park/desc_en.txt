Project undertaken during FORREC Summer Intensive Course of Forest Tourism and Recreation in Bragance (Portugal). 

The selected site is located next to the village Franca on the old fishing farm area next to the mountain slope and the river. The proposal includes the deep study on natural and cultural valueas of the park and the site which was supposed to make the place more attractive for forest tourusm and recreation. Two weeks of intensive work in site and in design office gave an opportunity to study not only the area of the design but also on the big context of the Park. 

Deep analysis of ecological processes, history and cultural values made decision makers able to identify potentials and values of the Park considered in wide context. Getting more data about the spot demanded few trips to the site and taking more photos, observing the plants and animalâ€™s species and human activity sign around the place. The first thing to notice after coming to the selected place is the fact of it extremely beautiful landscape.
