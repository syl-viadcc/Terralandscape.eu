If the plants organized the party...

Champagne garden bases its concept on the positive emotions connected with the party as a joyful, exciting and beautiful event. The dominant of this garden is a central round table-like stage covered with the pendulous plants (such as the table linen covers the round table). On the „table” there is a big sculpture referring to the champagne-glasses pyramid that is element of elegant and important celebrations.

However instead of bubbling champagne we put inside the plants and flowers that reveal associations with the champagne (such as strawberries and flowers on its color). They are planted in a hydrogel, so all of construction is see-through, and looks like a real consumption-ready pyramid! From underneath the table there are four water streams directed towards four sides of the gardens. Those streams are , metaphorically supplying the pyramid with water. That enables the visitor of a positive reflection and individual interpretation of the meaning of the garden , such as for example this is the party for little plants growing inside the glasses!.

Visitors can walk around the round table on the wooden boardwalk, and step out for standing areas with the metal barriers. Around there is a nice and joyful plantation that welcomes the visitors and full them with a positive-party-energy!
