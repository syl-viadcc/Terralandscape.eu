ProjectName: Bus Stop Area
ProjectLocation: Kozlow, PL
ProjectYear:2015

This area is to serve as a part of transportation infrastructure that is pleasant to the eye, and does not dominate over the natural landscape, but providing the spatial order in the bus stop area.

It is located at the entrance to the village Kruszyn in Southwest Poland, hence the project should meet the kind of representative functions and welcome the visitors. The design concept includes the planting plan for helping to organize the space and bond all parts of the site into a harmonious whole.

Greenery is planned in undulating forms, which would alleviate the structure of straight lines visible both in the roads, and nieghboring farms. The place that cements the composition of design is a bus stop. The project does not include any paths. It was recognized that in order to improve the functionality of this site paths are redundant, while only a collection of the outdoor furniture: a sitting area with trellises, which provides shielding from the sun for people awaiting the buses.

The focus is primarily on the visual qualities of vegetation, which will be visible for both drivers of passing cars, and people waiting for buses.
