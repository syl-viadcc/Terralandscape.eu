ProjectName: Recreation area
ProjectLocation: Rakowice, PL
ProjectYear:2015

This space can serve as a rest stop for cyclists, or pedestrians, and so can be used as a picnic and recreation area.

Also, this place will be viewed by people crossing paths at this point, it is to provide a nice accent in the landscape, which at the same time is not dominant on the surrounding cultural landscape. View of a pumping station and a drainage channel, is not desirable, therefore, we used solutions to mask the unwanted elements.
