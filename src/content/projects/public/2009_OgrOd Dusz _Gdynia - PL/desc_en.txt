ProjectName: Installation "Forest of the spirits"
ProjectLocation: Gdynia, PL
ProjectYear:2009

The park Kolibki in Gdynia-Orlowo held an unusual sculpture workshops. Unusual, because it welcomed the artists in a space remembering the times of Hetman Sobieski (later the king John III, "who drove the Turks from Vienna") Kolibki park, is also unusual because the subject of the exposition concerned plein air landscape and public space in the landscape. The design and execution of one of the winning installations belonged to us. The installation titled "Forest of the Spirits" had the following description:

"The souls and forest spirits, wandering among the trees, from time to time appear to people. Curious wanderers watch those translucent, luminous beings without fear, but with a reflection on transience."

The installation was made of a flexible mesh and a wire.
