ProjectName:Modernization of Palacio da Ajuda
ProjectLocation:Lisbon, PT
ProjectYear:2012

Ajuda National Palace is a unique building, both in terms of architectural character and its destiny. However, the size of this impressive neoclassical building only partially reflects the splendor and character of what the creators wanted to achieve. Because of lack of resources it was never fully completed. Especially the western facade of the palace strayed off the original plans.

The following concept of renewal of facade, involves the installation of stainless steel frame for support the west elevation . This structure, through the proper planting of climbers, for example, species or Parthenocissus tricuspidata or Hedera helix, and also by installing a network of metal wires, will be able to reflect more truly the shape and volume of a building. The growing vegetation do not need meticulous care, and their need for water and soil are small. The steel structure is relatively easy to install and low cost. Moreover, the whole construction will be completely non-invasive - not permanently connected to the existing building, so it will not be deformed. And if necessary, can be removed. An additional advantage of the project and the translucency and lightness of the green structure and the possibility of a dynamic change of color during the year (depending on the species)
