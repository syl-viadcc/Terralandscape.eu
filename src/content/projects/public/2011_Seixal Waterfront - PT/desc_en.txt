ProjectName:Seixal Waterfront
ProjectLocation:Seixal, PT
ProjectYear:2013

Southern Portugal is know for its beautiful beaches and waterfronts. One of the most famous waterfronts with great design potentials is located in the Setubal town.

Clear spatial solutions used for this concept are multiplying the beauty of the natural landscape of the waterfront. Light concrete and simple geometrical forms fit perfectly to the broad, blue surface of water.

Greenery had been limited to wide dark-leaved trees that give a shadow in a sunny days. The space is a high standard public boulevard, perfect for long summer walks.
