ProjectName: Green Solution for an Informal Parking
ProjectLocation: Komorów, PL
ProjectYear:2015

The concept of developing the square bases on the creation of green partitions in the triangle between the passageways so as to regulate the relationships visually, partially shutting the view of the railway, as well as to make it more difficult for illegal car parking.
Taking into account the two above mentioned issues, the land development problems can be solved by suitable design of green. It is proposed to introduce high vegetation of high decorative vaĂ§ues and modulating the terrain.
Change of the landuse from the parking lot into the biologically active aesthetically appealing, blending in with the existing environment is quite a radical change. The introduction of vegetation in this area will require improvement of the soil quality. For this purpose, the reclamation and partial replacement of the substrate will be necessary.
The spatial arrangement of the proposed elements of vegetation and topography are presented in two variants. Both variants are comparable in terms of the budget needed for the construction and maintenance. We tried to maximize the quality, attractiveness and ease of maintenance of greenery while minimizing the resources needed.

Variant 1 "Pastel clumps"
First option offers planting of trees in groups of three, evenly spread throughout the study. The proposed tree species is Acer negundo in a variety'Variegatum' or Sorbus aria. Selecting one of these species depends on the preference of the investor and the actual availability of the tree at the local nurseries. However, both species are characterized by high values ââof decorativeness and similar habitat requirements. Both are also equally compatible with the concept.
The spaces between "clumps" of trees will be filled with Spiraea shrubs, which creates a low, tight coverage area. This plant is undemanding in terms of habitat, but very attractive in the summer months -pink flowers , and autumn - beautiful discoloration.
The area under the canopy will be covered with the bark that will provide adequate conditions for the growth of trees and to prevent the development of weeds.

Option 2 "Birch mounds"
In Option 2, terrain is undulating so that it can no longer serves as a car parking. The degraded soil can be reused to shape the irregular mounds, with birch thees characterized by clear white bark planted on tops of them. Covering an area of ââmounds with Japanese pachysandra or ivy, forming a dense, evergreen groundcover.
Irregular stripes between the hills were filled with a lawn that is recommended to mow several times a year.
