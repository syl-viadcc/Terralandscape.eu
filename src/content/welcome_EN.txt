We are a team of experienced landscape architects, who first launched in 2009. Since then, we've created unique gardens across Portugal, Scotland, Poland, Italy, and France. Recently we've branched out to the USA. 

Our designs for the south Florida area are built with the support of GardenAesthetica.com, who ensures our projects are realized with the highest quality of construction and maintenance at a reasonable price.
The essence of our design philosophy is to join together high aesthetics, functionality, and that certain special spark that just makes you feel good to be there! 

In our designs we always strive to reflect a great respect to the natural habitat and climatic conditions. We offer reasonable prices and an individualized, case-to-case treatment for each and every client.
